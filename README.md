# OneDrive Photo Organizer
Command line tool to organize camera roll photos by year/month folders on OneDrive.
This tool is using the image date taen property to get the creation date
if date taken property is not available, it extracts the date from the file name
then organizes the file in year/month folders in the same directory.
Usage:

PhotoOrganizer.exe -path:"your OneDrive pictures folder path"

You can use batch files to pass the path and call this tool with one click or use task scheduler to call this tool.
